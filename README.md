## Elemental cycle

Light <- Dark <- Fire <- Water <- Air <- Earth

The damage that one element does to another depends on where they are they are
in the cycle. Each element does the least damage to itself and the most damage
to the element on its left.

### Light <- Dark

"Evil will always triumph over good, because good is dumb." --Spaceballs

### Dark <- Fire

It can't be dark where there's fire. Also, undead are dry and flammable.

### Fire <- Water

Water puts out fire.

### Water <- Air

Air evaporates water. Water can't do anything to air.

### Air <- Earth

Gases can't penetrate solids at all.

### Earth <- Light

Angels are really good at changing things on the physical plane to get their
way.
